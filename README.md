# video-agency
A website I'm just wrapping up for a buddy of mine who is starting his own video agency - live version is here: http://www.tylerjewett.com/

This project was a bit of a challenge - there are a TON of videos hosted here, so getting things to load quickly was (and still is) difficult.

The biggest task was to create shortcodes to display the separate projects for this site - I was able to create a simple, dynamic shortcode to load in whatever video/image assets were necessary for the project page, and display them below the standard post content, which was something I had never tried before - pretty fun stuff!
